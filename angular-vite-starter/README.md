# Angular Vite Starter

This is a starter for Angular with Vite. It uses the [@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular](https://github.com/analogjs/analog/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-angular) to provide Angular support in Vite.

## Installation

To use this starter, ensure you have the plugin installed:

```bash
npm install @analogjs/vite-plugin-angular --save-dev
```

## Configuration

Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your `vite.config.ts`. The angular plugin should be listed **first** in the plugins array.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import angular from '@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    mainFields: ['module'],
  },

  plugins: [angular()],
});
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
